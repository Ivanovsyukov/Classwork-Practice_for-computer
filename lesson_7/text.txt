Each and every day hiding from the sunshine
Wandering in the shade, not too old, not too young
Every night again dancing with the moonlight
Somewhere far away, I can hear your call
I'm out of my head, of my heart and my mind
'Cause you can run, but you can't hide, I'm gonna make you mine
Out of my head, of my heart and my mind
'Cause I can feel how your flesh now is crying out for more
Ain't no fairytale what I see in your eyes
Awaiting your mistake, not too close, not too far
Sneaking in the pain, every truth becomes lie
I won't trust myself once I hear your call
I'm out of my head, of my heart and my mind
'Cause you can run, but you can't hide, I'm gonna make you mine
Out of my head, of my heart and my mind
'Cause I can feel how your flesh now is crying out for more
I'm out of my head, of my heart and my mind
Out of my head, of my heart and my mind
I'm out of my head, of my heart and my mind
'Cause you can run, but you can't hide, I'm gonna make you mine
Out of my head, of my heart and my mind
'Cause I can feel how your flesh now is crying out for more
